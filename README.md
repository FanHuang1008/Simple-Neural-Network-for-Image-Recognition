# Simple-Neural-Network-for-Image-Recognition
After reading the book "Make Your Own Neural Network" by Tariq Rashid, I decided to follow the author's guidance and built a simple neural network to recognize handwritten numbers. What amazed me the most was I could bulid a neural network without using the common deep learning libraries, such as Tensorflow or Keras. 

To have better understanding of how various parameters affect the performance of the neural network, I adjusted learning rate, change the number of hidden nodes, and tried different epoch respectively. Results were visualized for better interpretation.
